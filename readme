steps to delete columns

1. pip install required imports
2. move the csv you want to make changes to into a folder with the script
3. on lines 8 and 9 enter the name of the csv your changing and your desired name of the output (make them the same to overwrite, although I wouldnt reccomend this because if you mess up you cant get it back)
4. on line 18, specify the column or columns you want to delete, if your deleting multiple make sure its 1 per line and the correct syntax
5. run the file
